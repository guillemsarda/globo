This is a webpage that was created for my friend Monica. She wanted a website for a master's project. 

The aim of the project was to assert people's rights to free access to any country. Therefore, she wanted to create a **global ID card** that everyone is allowed to get. And this what the webpage delivers.

## Tech Stack
Since the app was meant to be simple, I chose to build it using jQuery.<br/> 
The style was achieved using TailwindCSS and it is mobile responsive. <br/>
All the code that was online retrieved is properly citated.
